 A program that makes you type symbols instead of numbers

I wrote this app for myself.

My main programming OS is Windows which is why I wrote it for windows.

Why do I need this? 

Whenever I type number while programming I use Numpad numbers. I don't want to be constantly pressing shift to get my symbols, it's annoying.

How to use it?

1. Run the app
2. Type the non-Numpad number and straight away instead of them, you will get symbols. If you're using not US keyboard you will get whatever you would get pressing together with the shift.
