 Program that makes you type symbols instead of numbers

I wrote this app for myself.

My main programming OS is Windows which is why I wrote it for windows.

Why do I need this? 

Whenever I type number while programming I use numpad numbers. I don't want to be constantly pressing shift to get my symbols, it's annoying.
